# Mock-Agile-SNHU-Travel
In my class I was given an opportuntity to conduct a mock review and retrospective for a sprint.

  I interpret the user needs and implement them into a program by composing user stories and incorporating them to the sprint. Creating user stories help with implementation by extrapolating a user need and composes the purcursor to the implementation. 

  I approach developing programs with an open mind and aim to satisfy as many requirements as possible. The agile processe I hope to inforpoarate into my future development are the communication of scrum team members. Enable team members to be self organizing and communicate as necessary is a unique and special kind of project management style.

  To be a good team member in software development is to be accountable, self organizing and resourceful. Being an independent contributor who synergizes with a team.
